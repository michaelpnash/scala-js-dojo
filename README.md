ScalaJS Type mappings for the Dojo JS framework

This project provides type-safe mappings for accessing the Dojo JavaScript framework from Scala, compiled to JavaScript via ScalaJS.

This means it is possible to write your entire UI in Scala.

See http://github.com/michaelpnash/scala-js-dojo-example for an example project using this library.
